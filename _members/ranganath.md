## Aditya Ranganath

"As a political scientist, Ranganath is interested in exploring how the complex interrelationships between capitalism, democracy, and technological change affect world politics. He is also interested in the political economy of big data, data science, and automation (particularly with a view towards exploring the extent to which Marx's writings on the relationship between capitalism, technology, and automation can cast light on the contemporary societal ramifications of these technological developments). As a librarian, Ranganath is interested in the political economy of libraries and open data; data curation; pedagogical approaches to data literacy education; and reproducible research."
