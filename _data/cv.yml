    - name: Description
      value: Data Advocacy for All aims to extend data humanities education and invigorate DEI initiatives across the CU system by developing a modular approach to teaching data advocacy, supported by a Open Access (OA) digital repository of educational resources. Whether used by nonprofits to catalyze social action, think tanks to argue for policy change, or organizations to promote legislative equity, data advocacy is an increasingly important means of communication in the big data era. While more and more CU students are being exposed to the technical aspects of data science, a complex array of data skills and literacies are needed to use data responsibly and create positive change in the world. Data advocacy is an integrative, ethical practice of analysis, design, and communication in which insights from a dataset are effectively conveyed to raise public awareness and drive social change. Envisioned by a team of digital humanities faculty at CU Boulder and Denver in concert with CU Boulderâ€™s Center for Research Data and Digital Scholarship (CRDDS), the Data Advocacy for All project is in the process of designing, building, teaching, and assessing a civically engaged, experiential curricular approach to data advocacy. This approach will leverage multiple technologies to enhance student abilities to ethically and effectively inquire with data, communicate with data, and deploy data to create more just futures.
