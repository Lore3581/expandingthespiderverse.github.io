### About the Speaker

Dr. Lindsay Porier is an assistant professor of Statistical and Data Sciences at Smith College and a leading cultural anthropologist of data advocacy, governance, and infastructure. Despite academia's tendency to distance cultural and social theory from computational and quantitative methods, Dr. Porier excels in both areas and combines them together in a way that is rare among scholars.
